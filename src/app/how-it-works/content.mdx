# How Solana Promises Work

## Self-Promise Smart Contract

A Solana program that enables users to make commitments to themselves using SOL as promise amount

The Solana program implements a unique concept of self-promises, where users can commit SOL to fulfill personal goals or commitments. Here's how it works:

## Key Features

### Making a Promise
- Users lock a minimum of 0.01 SOL (10,000,000 lamports) as promise amount
- Each promise has a unique identifier based on the creator's address, text, deadline, and size
- A small fee (0.005 SOL) is paid to the program author for maintenance
- The promise is stored in a Program Derived Address (PDA)

### Fulfilling a Promise
- Only the original creator can fulfill their promise
- Must be fulfilled before the deadline
- Upon fulfillment, the locked SOL is returned to the creator
- The promise account is closed and its rent is refunded to the creator

### Breaking a Promise
- If the deadline passes without fulfillment, the promise can be broken
- Only the program author can break promises after the deadline
- The locked SOL is sent to the program author as a penalty
- The promise account is closed and its rent is refunded to the creator

## Technical Implementation

The program uses several Solana concepts to ensure security and proper execution:

- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to store promise data
- Account validation using seeds derived from promise parameters
- Native SOL transfers for promise amount and fees
- Time-based validation using Solana's Clock sysvar
- Proper account cleanup and rent refund on promise completion

### Timing and Authorization Rules
- Promise fulfillment is strictly time-gated: users can only fulfill their promise before the deadline
- After the deadline passes, the promise can no longer be fulfilled by the creator
- Only the program author has the authority to break promises after the deadline
- These rules are enforced through on-chain time checks and strict authorization validation
